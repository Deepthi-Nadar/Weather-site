# TODO: Make Historical Search Responsive

- [x] Add media query for max-width: 600px to .historical-search: set flex-direction to column and align-items to stretch
- [x] Set #histDate and #histTime to width: 100% in the same media query
- [x] Optionally adjust button styles for full width if needed
- [x] Test the layout on small screens to ensure buttons and inputs fit within the container
